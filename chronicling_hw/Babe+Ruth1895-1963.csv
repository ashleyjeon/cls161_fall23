Home Run Monareh Makes
Mightie&t Hit of Career
Babe Drives De \ italis's Offering Nearly 500 Feet,
but It Was Only in Practice; Yankees Deny
Reported Deal for Catcher Wally Schang
By W. J. Macbeth
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., March 19.-?In batting: practise this after?
noon ""Babe"" Ruth attained one of his springtime exhibitions. Tho burly
Home Run King oC the diamond drove lhc ball far beyond thc confines
of the right centcr field fei.ee?a hit that would have been a home run
outside the crrounds of anv major leaorue ball lot.
It may bc there are to be other'
spring home runs borri to blush nn
seen, but few will ever attain thc dis?
tance or flat trajectory that astoniahed
the two score rail bVd* asscmbled at
Scuth Side Park to see how Uuth's
mighty shoulder can gropel thc sphcroid
when he lays the old ash fairly on a
piteh. ?
Ruth is the only ball player <ever
known to have hammercd a baseball
from the plate over any of the fences
of the Yankeo training lot. His elout
to-day was the second cbntribution of
the kind. In tho opening game afjainst
Brooklyn last Saturday Ruth drove far
over the right tield paling, but the wind
carried the* drive into foul territory by
thirty feet. This afternoon's clout waa
just a little to the right of ccriter lield.
His Mightiest Wallop
Ruth himself believes to-day's hit,
which was made off a fast one from
Mario De Vitalis, the Brown University
piteher, was one of the most remarkable
batting achievements of an honorable
career. He has hit balls further, but
never harder.
This drive was a low liner which
never seemed to carry more than thirty
feet into the air and which shot out
like a wicked low drive from the tee.
It didn't seem possible at first that the
carry could attain anything approxi
mating the fence, and when the ball
finally disappeared beyond the boards
it was easing to earth ?very slowly, ap?
parently.
Coach Charlie O'Leary, who was play
ing a' deep centre field at the time, re
trieved the lost ball. He said it cleared
the barrier by fifteen or twenty feet.
O'Leary marked the spot where the ball
was found, which was more than fifty
feet outside the ground on heavy,
marshy soil that would permit little or
no roll.
Later Groundkeeper Phil Schenck
got his steel tape and measured the carry
an closely as could be estimated. His
official estimate credited Ruth with a
drive of 478 feet. The significance of
this will be appreriated by New York
fans when it is remembered that the
extreme center field fence of the Polo
Grounds is less than 400 feet from the
home plate.
Duplkatcs Hit of 1919
A year ago this spring at Tanpa,
Fla., in an exhibiUon gome against ""t""e
Giants, Ruth, then a memucT of tho
Boston Red Sox, broke up a game on
Piteher George Smith with what is
generally credited as the longest hit
of baseball history, the ball coming to
a stop 559 feet from the home plate.
His offering on that occasion was a
tremendously high fly that started on
an angle of about 45 degvoes and car?
ried far over the head of Ross Young,
who was playing extremely deep for
the slugger.
The hit off DeVitalis undoubtedly
had a greater carry and on the same
sort of hard field would probably
have rolled further, too.
The customary game between the
first and second teams was dispensed
with this afternoon. The long drill
was confined chiefly to batting practice,
a deticiency dectdedly pronounced in
the two games played against the Dodg?
ers in this city.
Dan Holly, scout of the Boston Red
Sox, is sojourning in our midst. Evi
dently Barrow is anxious to have a line
on most of the new talent in the major
league camp against that day when
it will be necessary for managers to
ask waivers in getting to the twenty
flve player limit.
Not to Trade Bodie
It was rumored here several days
ago that the Yankees were making.
overtures for catcher Wally Schang, of
the Red Sox, and that Barrow might
have Ping Bodie in a swap for the
hackstop. Business Manager Harry
Sparrow denies the rumor emphatl
cally.
Armando Marsans goes to tho Red
Sox for the waiver price and Boston
will not have to pay for him unless
the Cuban makes good. Huggins be?
lieves that Marsans1 is through as a
major league asset and unworthy of
further trial by the Yankees. But he
is willing the teniperamental outfielder
continue in the profession if he can
again make the grade.
The weather to-day was warm, al?
most muggy, despite a high wind that
had sand and dirt blowing in clouds
all over the streets. The wind, by the
way, blew directly at right angles to
the flight of Ruth's terrific hit and in
no way helped its carry. Such a hit
on opening day, in the opinion of Dean
Sam Crane, would pay for Ruth.

The World's Greatest
""I contend,"" interpolates a ring-side or a mat-side habituee, ""that
Earl Caddock is the world's greatest wrestler, despite the fact that he
has been beaten by both Stecher and Lewis. Their victories were merely
a matter of superior weight. A side-kick with whom I have frequent
arguments says I am loony, that the world's champion wrestler is bound
to be the world's greatest wrestler, or he wouldn't be champion."" This
argument is merely another of those word spillers which scatter the lan?
guage broadcast, with no definite goaLto be reached.
In so far as skill, courage, aggressiveness, alertness, versatility and
mat intelligence go, Caddpck is superior to both Stecher and Lewis.
But his margin of greatness is not sufficient to wipe out his deficit of
from forty to fifty pounds in weight.
In the heavyweight class power and weight are also essential quali?
ties, which Caddock lacka when he faces either Stecher or Lewis.
Pound for pound, Caddock is the world's best wrestler. But he hasn't
pound for pound to exchange in a trade. Where he stops at 182 his
two rivals go on above 225.
? You might easily say that Caddock is the most skillful wrestler in
the world. But greatness in sport goes largely with results. Which, 95
per cent of the time, is where greatness belongs in any turn of existence.
Nature's Part
Nature persists in playing a big part in arranging the drama of
sport. It is merely Caddock's misfortune that he lacks the extra thirtv
nve or forty pounds.
Nature made Jess Willard the world's heavyweight champion when
he lacked skill, quickness, ring intelligence and most of the requisites
which belong to the boxing elect.
But nature's gift of 250 pounds and 83 inches of reach when com?
petition was at low ebb happened to be enough.
When the great white liope scramble was under way Willard hap?
pened to be the tallest, the heaviest, the strongest and the higgest of the
lot. Who could imagine Willard winning a heavyweight championship
weighing only 185 pounds or 195 pounds?
If Ferdinand Schupp had only had the physical strength and stamina
to last he would have been one of the greatest pitchers of all time
His 1916 record with the Giants is still the high mark?an average
of 1.09 earned runs to each game through a season?-a mark that Mathew
son, Alexander and Johnson have yet to reach. But where Schupp was
thin and .light, the others were six-footers and 200-pounders.
Here and there rare spirits, such as Johnny Evers or Eddie Colnns
emerge to run the long gantlet. But most of those who held the long
route to greatness were men such as Wagner, Mathewson, Wa'ddell
Anson, Johnson Alexander, Walsh. Cy Young, Lajoie and others who
had the physical bulk to roll back tU assaults of time and fate.
How about Cobb? Well, who is six feet tall; he weighs 185 pounds,
and nature gave him amazh,"" *^ed. That's enough for a starter, any
way. ' *
""Should professlonal football be encouraged?"" a reader asks If
the promoters of professlonal football use any intelligence they will not
only refrain from going after college stars still in college, but will re?
fuse to use any such material. Because is doing so they become a heavy
menace to amateur sport, and this means war with all-who believe that
amateur sport is the basis of all recreation. Properly conducted, pro?
fessional football might have its place. But not at the expense of any
present standards of amateur play.

College Mermen
In Titular Meet
At Yale To-night
Special Correttpondence to The Tribune
NEW HAVEN, Conn., March 19?En?
tries from ten colleges have been re?
ceived by President Chamberlain of
the Yale Swimming Association for the
intercollegiate meet, which will be held
in the Carnegie pool here to-morrow
night to decide the individual swim?
ming ehampionships.
Aside from the five regular members
of the Intercollogiate Association,
Princeton, Pennsylvania, Columbia,
College of the City of New York and
Yale, the mermen of Harvard, Amherst,
Wesleyan, Rutgers and Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, will compete.
Harvard has not developed swimming
as have the other large Eastern uni
versities, but it pluokily sent a team
to Yale on Wednesday for the first
meet known with the Eli's in years,
and hope is now felt that the Crimson
will enter the association another
year.
Yale's swimming team contains more
record breakers than ever before and
it is likely to capture most of the
events. The feat of the relay team
lowering the 200-yard record on
Wednesday to 1 minute, 39 4-5 sec?
onds, clipping a second off the record,
was the most briiliant achievement of
the season.
The four entries, Captains, Hincks,
Thurston, Binney and Solley, were com?
pelled to swim their fifty yards in less
than 25 seconds each to achieve the
result and, as 25 seconds was the inter?
collegiate record for fifty yards when
the season opened, the record is likely
to stand as the world's figures for
some time.

Giants Break
Camp; Start
Tour To-day
Open Exhibition Series With
Red Sox in Fort Worth;
Players Are in Condition
Special Dinpat.ch to The Triburti
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., March 19.?
With every regular member of the
team physically fit and ready for a
long and hard campaign the Giants
terminated their spring training sea
Kon at League Park here to-day. Man?
ager McGraw put his athletes through
a light workout in the morning and
then told them that they were through
for the day.
Late to-night twenty regulars, ac?
companied by Manager McGraw and
Christy Mathewson, now coach of the
team, embarked upon a ""rattlcr"" for
Fort Worth, Tex., where the first shot
in the long series of exhibition games
with the Ruth-lgss Red Sox will be
fired.
McGraw has not announced his
pitching selection, but Arthur Nehf
and Rube Benton, the two southpaws,
are picked to oppose the American
Leaguers.
The training season which came to
an end to-day was the best that the
Giants have ever indulged in. In
nearly three weeks of practice they
only lost a single day, the first Sunday,
when the cold wave which was sweep?
ing over the country arrived in San
Antonio. Even .though it was only
three points above the freezing point,
McGraw had his players on the field
for twenty minutes.
The little manager is highly pleased
with conditions. hero, and it is whis?
pered that the Giants will again do
thc<r preliminary training in this town
next year. The playing field at League
Park is one of the best among the
minor league cities, and under a warm
sun it did not take the veterans -iong
to eliminate the kinks from their
muscles.
Barnes, Toney, Douglas, Nehf and
Benton, McGraw's big five, are fit and
ready, and the Red Sox will find it
mighty hard to make base hits during
the coming series. The Giants are con?
fident of winning the majority of the
games from Barrow's men. Last year,
it will be remembered, the American
Leaguers kind of showed up McGraw's
athletes by winning four out of six
games. It will also be remembered that
Babe' Ruth's smashing, crashing and
home run makin.-r bat aided the Red
Sox in winning these four games. Take
away Ruth from any team and it loses
its punch.
Manager McGraw will leave sixteen
of his recruits here in charge of Mike
Gonzales, the Cuban catcher. These
players will rejoin the club in this city
when the Giants and Red Sox come back
here for their exhibition game next
Wednesday.
The players leaving to-night are:
George Burns, Ross Young, Benny
Kauff, Arnold Statz, George Kelly,
Larry Doyle, Arthur Fletcher, Frank
Frisch, Eddie Sicking, Earl Smith, Lew
McCarty, Frank Snyder, Jesse Winters,
Bill Ryan, Wilbur Hubbell and the
five pitchers mentioned above.

Konetchy's Homer Saves Rout
McGraw's Maulers Clinch Game in First inning on
Singles by Burns and Young and Frisclvs
Triple: Toney Beats Smith; Score, 3 to 1
? By Charles A. Taylor
A World's Series crowd injected with many oodles of World's Series
spirit saw the Brawl of Boroughs resumed yesterday at the Polo Grounds
after a rainy lapse of two days. The restless t*_rong was estimated at
;#,000, and this despite the fact that the gates wete closed to all except
ticket holders as early as 2:15 p. m. It was som# ""mob"" that watched
the Giants triumph over the ""Bridge Travelers"" fu*!. Flatbush by a score
of S to 1 in just about as well-played a game *_, could be asked from
the most exacting fan.
Th? word ""mob"" 13 used most ad
visedly, for these 88,000 watcher
never ceased their yells and yowls an
boo-hooes from the tima the practic
.__8ion began until Zachary Whea
iSied to Lee King in center for the fina
out of the contest. The innocent by
Stander, that term covering the fen
who did keep their heads on thei
shoulders and their lungs at ease, wa
doubtless amazed at the general all
round ""mobbiness"" of the crowd.
Of course, these ""Innocents Abroad
had never been so far abroad as Flat
bush on those certain days last weel
when Uncle Wiibert and his nine am
his multitudes of rooters just playe<
our Giants off all their feet
heaping reams of abuse upon their vie
tuns meanwhile. It was a chapte
snatched by the Manhattanites fron
the ""Book of Flatbush"" that caused al
the yowling, jeers and boo-hooes.
Frank Frisch the Hero
If one were called upon to selec
two or three heroes developed in thi:
most magnificent diamond battle, Mr
Frank Fordham Frisch would deserv?
the honor throne, with Ross Young, o:
San Antonio, and Ed Konetchy, of ?o
hernia, finishing second and third, re
spectively.
It was this ""upstart"" from the col
lego world cf two years ago that put t<
nought the sterling work of Sherroc
Smith, southpaw par excellence ?V:
Brooklyn. In only one inning wa:
Sherrie what you might call at all ap
proachable. and it was then that thi?
Fordham Flash pounced upon the left
hander for the blow that Bent 38,00<
fans into a frightful frenzy.
George Burns opened on Smith witr
a single to left, only to be forced &'
?econd by Dave Bancroft. Sherrod was
mightily encouraged at the snuffing out
of Burns, but old and dire fate cam?
to the plate along with Frisch and his
bat.
Frar.kk Fordham certainly wallopec
that southpaw slant that broke so per?
fectly over the platter. The drive car?
ried almost to the exit gate in righl
center and Bancroft and Frisch begar
a merry spin around. Bancroft score.
and Frisch pulled up at third as Peter
kin Kilduff relayed the clout to Olsoc
at second.
Two Singles for Young
Ross Young next appeared upon th?
?K-no a? Hero No. 2. Ross shot the ball
?.bird for a single that enabled
to finish his scoring journey
\ntonio Young was also a potent
ta the production of the Giants'
and last tally which, in the ver
r, ""put the game on ice."" There
two men out in the eighth frame
when Young duplicated his hit of the
nning, went to second on a passed
Sail an?i sped over the rubber following
L_ag George Kelly's beautifully placed
punch to right field.
The prais_ due the Bohemian. Ko
n.tchy is of the sort accrues to a m.a
hravp and true who tries to make up
for the shortcomings of his mates by
playing a strong hand alone. This
Konetchy person took especial delight
in the pitching of Fred Toney, the
Giant boxman.
On his first appearance at the plate
Big Ed shot a wicked single through
<he underpinning of ""Goldie"" Rapp
This happened in the second inning,
In the fifth session Koney was the first
Brooklyn batter, and he surely batted.
The ball he connected with cut through
the air on a line into the left field
bleachers.
This stupendous effort resulted in the
only run scored by the Dodgers, but
Koney did not stop here in his efforts
to do it all. In his third and last ap?
pearance with his war club the Bo?
hemian, with one man out, smashed the
ball between third and short for his
third hit, but only to realize at last
that his pals were of absolutely no
assistance.
But it was an honest-to-goodness ball
game, and Charlea H. Ebbcts, Squire of
Flatbush, better have his lamps
trimmed and burning and his stands
and bleachers reinforced in strongest
fashion to welcome the thousands who
will call upon him at his ball park to?
morrow, when the Brawl of the Bor?
oughs will be continued. The score of
the ""Brawl"" now stands 4 to 2 in favor
of Flatbush.
Wonderful Play by Frisch
Before dismissing Fordham Frisch
for the day a word should be said in
appreciation of his wonderful infield
Playing, as well as his timely hitting.
In the first inninj. he grabbed from no?
where a blow from the bat of Griffith
?hieb had gone through Long George
Kelly so fast that the home runner
couldn't see it go. Griffith got a hit,
despite Fri_ch's marvelous stop, but
only because Fred Toney was a bit
?low in covering the bag.
Peterkln Kilduff, who i? nursing a
lame leg, had to be removed from the
game in the fifth inning, after Peter
fcins had rapped a double along the
left field foul line. Neis ran for Kil,
and in the next inning Robbie sent
Neis to center and placed Hy Myers
on second.
A double play performed by Griffith
*nd Miller in the seventh was a clever
Piece of work. Lee King was on third
and one man was out when Burns skied
to Griffith. King put on his best speed
in an endeavor to reach the plate
after the catch, but Griffith's throw
was sure and true.

Long George Turns Jeers of
Home Run Fans Into
Cheers for His Slugging
By Charles A. Taylor
The latest edition of Who's Who in
Baseball, at hand, makes no mention
of Long Gaorge Kelly, the moat recent
entry in the homs run race. The omis?
sion is not surprising, for Long
George was ever nlodeat, and he only
started on the Babe Ruth path this
year. The latest statistics disclose the
fact that Long George is only one be?
hind the Babe in circuit clouts, but Mr.
Kelly never acted this way before, no
""Who's Who"" ignored him.
And now it seems fitting that wo
should take a good look at this man
Kelly. (That's the reason for the ac?
companying pictures.) Long George is
one of those ""native sons"" which,
translated, means he first saw the light
of day on the Pacific Coast.
From the Northwestern League he
finally drifted across the continent to
the Giants, who turned him over to
Pittsburgh. Then he went to the
Rochester club of the International
League. He compiled a good batting
average there, and in the course of
time John J, McGraw took due notice
and Long George was summoned from
upstate to the Big Town.
Fooled by Good Pitching
Walter Hoik?, who had been playing
first base for the Giants until one of
those famous ""Boston trades"" deliv
eriid him to the Hub, had left the

CLEVELAND, May 7.?-Cleveland to?
day defeated Chicago by the same score
as yesterday, 8 to 0. Mails was very
effective, especially with men on bases,
the White Sox threatening but once,
although they had nine men left on the
bases.
The champions drove Wilkinson from
the box in three innings, and also hit

initial bag vacant, and Long George
from the bushes was called to duty.
Now Long George had had whole lots
of fun with the pitching in the Inter?
national, and he came to the Big Town
with the idea that he could knock the
cover off any ball these big league fel?
lows tossed up to him. George was
sadly mistaken. He was fed curves of
a sort he never saw before, and when
the Polo Grounds multitudes saw
George come up with runners on base
they groaned and jeered.
""Three men out"" was their cry. And j
George usually lived up to the jeers i
by fanning the breezes from the near-1
by Harlem or popping up to the infleld.
Day after day luck broke against
""Kel"" and the jeers and groans in?
creased in volume whenever this ""up- .
Btart busher"" Btepped to the plate. '
They were sorry days for Kelly, but !
one man, and the big boss at that,
stuck to Long George. John J. Mc
Graw was the man. He was certain he I
had unearthed a real ball player and
he turned back tho pages of baseball !
history and saw himself in his* early |
Oriole days. John J. Mc stuck to j
Kelly and, what is of much more im?
port, Long George kept his head up |
through all the tirades of fandora
hereabouts.
And now let's see what Long George j
has accomplished with his ""nerve"" and
his bat. The baseball statisticians are
watching this home-run fledgling with
all their microscopes. The big feature
of baseball to-day is not the ordinary
race for a pennant but the race for
home-run honors.
Sluggers in Merry Battle
As the presses are grinding out this
tale of Kelly the score between Babe
Ruth and Long George is 8 to 7, with
the season still drinking from the
springs of youth. What the final score
will be between these wonder batters
not even the scrutinating fan can tell.
i But all agree now that it is going to
be a real battle.
Long George knocked his first home
? run as a major leaguer in September
of 1919. Al Demaree, former Giant,
pitching for Boston, hurled the ball
that went out of the lot. In 1920 Mr.
Kelly banged out eleven homers, but
his mighty clouting attracted little at?
tention because of the frightful mis?
behavior along the same lines by Babe
Ruth.
But in this year 1921 it is found
that whereas the famous Babe is
speeding far beyond his record, this
long ignored Long George Kelly is
battling Bambino to a standstill.
""Watchful waiting,"" as one of our
ex-Presidents said, is the only answer
as to who will be ""WWs Who"" as
leading home-runner in 1921.

2 Runs in Final Inning
Special Diitpaich ta The Tribw?
WASHINGTON, May 7?The Yankee?
came from behind in their final battie
of the series with the Senators an*
swept Walter Johnson down to defeat
undedr a merciless fir* of iong-dis
tanea hits. The score was 6 t*> 6. Boh
Mensel'.? triple that bounced ?? th?
left-field fence Bent the deciding runs
across the plate. Bob's smash came at
the time when Bobby Roth was hugging
third and Walter Pipp was on firs*.
Former President Wilson wag among
those who witnessed the ?awe. Babe
Ruth delivered his greatest bom? run,
a crashing wallop that would have car?
ried into the center-field stand? oa the
Polo Grounds. Ruth made bis driva Ib
the eighth inning.
Meusel also slammed oat ? ham? ran,
and, in addition, he got a tripla, a
double and a single. He accounted for
no fewer than five of the Yankees* run?.
He scored Pipp with his homer, scored
on Ward's double in the eighth end
won the game with his crasher in tae
ninth.
Hoggins Has Three Pitcher?
The battle was a slagfest from the
start, end Miller Huggins scored only
after he had sent three pitchers into
the fray. Jack Quinn first tried out his
dampened slants upon the bats of the
Senators, but he was swatted out of the
box in less than two innings. Then
Hoyt took command, but he was dex
ricked after the Senators had made a
base hit off him in the ninth. Carl
Mays finished the game, and, aided by
two fine plays by Ward and Baker,,
held the Senators off the plat?.
The Senators were in the lead whan.
the Yanks came up in the last inning.
They had made a run when Ben
Meusel's thi-ow on O'Rourke's ?ingle
got through Baker, Shanks crossing the
plates and breaking the tie. Bobby Roth
tapped a slow roller down to Shanks
and beat it out for a base bit. Peek
then hit down, the left field foul line,
and Bill Dine?n called it a foul. The
Yanks averred that the ball had hit on
the foul line, and a mighty argument
followed.
Peck flined oat, and Ruth, hooted by
the crowd for his part in the argument,
flied out. Pipp flied over *,he infield,
and it went for a base hit. Roth rushed
to third. Meusel then hit the ball far
over Milan's head for a triple to the
left field fence.
The defense of the YanSeeTwaa ?tal
wait. J. Franklin Baker made a couple
of fine plays.
Base on Balls for Rutk
It was apparent soon after the start
of the game that th? batten? would
have field day at the expense of tha
pitchers. After Bobby Roth was set
down in the first inning, Peck whacked
one to left for a base hit, and sped to
Becond when Johnson was guilty of a
wild pitch. Ruth drew a base on
balls. Pipp was easily disposed of, bat
Meusel beat one down to Shanks, and
won the race to first. Baker we.? easy.
The Senators shoved three runs
across in their half of the second in?
ning. Harris slashed a liner to Ruth,
; who made a good catch of an easy play.
Shanks singled over second. O'Rourk?
laced a blow to center and Picinich fei
lowed this example, ?coring Shanks.
Johnson then hit the right field wall
with a double and O'Rourke raced
home, Picinich taking third.
Waite Hoyt was then introduced.
Judge, the first man to face him, laced
a long fly to Roth, which scored Piehi
nich. Johnson was caught in the run
up and retired, Roth to Peck to Ward.
Another run was scored in tfte third.
Mi?an was out, but Rice got a two-bag?
ger, thanks to ""Babe"" Ruth. Peck was
under the fly back on the grass when
Ruth thundered in like a tank and
called the play. Then he missed the
bail. Brewer's single and a long fly by
Harris produced this tally.
The score:

rurn your memory back a few brief

Boston Red Sox never lost a world

in 1915, the Robins in 1910 and the

lluth who hammered in the first run

iniching tally with his double and his
larlng steal of home in the fifth. And
it was Schang who supported Mays in
vinning form.
The Giants have a great machine.
But after all, who are they to over?

ipon the tradition of eighteen years""
While Mays was toying with the

FINAL SCORE
New York Yankees.'?'? 7 '
Now York Giants.u '?> (
through as a leading as?""i. But after
all, one day doesn't make a scries.
Yankee strategy came to light in
still another quaint way. Knowing the
speed and eureness of the star Ginnt
rutfield, composed of Burns. Young und
Meusel, the Yanks refrained from hit?
ting a fly to any one of tire three.
None of the trio had a put-out to Iris
c-rodir, and with a hitless day at bat
throAvn in they accumulated more
ciphers than a carload of doughnuts.
Giants Below Form
With four successive hits out of
four times up for Frisch, a steal of
'?re nie and an entire outfield bereft of
a put-out, three records; were broken
insofar as we can recall the vital sta?
tistics of past years. These can at
least stand ns records until someone
Iras paged AI Munro Elias and put him
forcibly upon the stand for additional
testimony.
In the first test the Giants, sup
pressed so completely by Mays, were
? c low standard form. When a ball
club isn't hitting, it is usually a bit
lumpy in other ways. Frisch alone up?
held the glory of his league, in ad?
dition to his unbroken string of base
hits, his play at third Avas a leading
feature. It was a large afternoon foi
both third basemen, although Mc
N'ally had little to do in the defensive
si ctor.
With Cnrl Maya out of the way foi
a breathing spell and An Nehf ready
to pick up where Douglas and Barnes
i?*ft off, the Giants look for better
tilings in the second battle. They hope
to make up the big deficit against
lloyt and Sha-.vkey who won't insist
upon shooting at them fron; the tops
of their shoe laces. They are also
wondering whether Mays again can
have such uncanny control of that low
knee-high ball that err! only the corner-.
But they have aso found the *3 a ke<
are not to be taken too lightly ?\s s
defensive machine. They must figure
too that Huggins's Howitzers can't be
spiked forever arid that if they can win
a game without calling upon the bi?
blast they are just that much to the
good.
Wc Win Anyhow
At'ccr the 50-50 or the 52-4S attitude
of the opening crowd, 'here is also tin
chance that the rival partisans will
develop greater rivalry as the series
moves along and a few old-fashioned
outbursts will follow the unexpected
lull of yesterday. The crowd proved
'hen that no keen rivalry exista among
tire home club partisans arid (hat at
least three out of five are satisfied to
know that whatever happens the cham
'. pionship will stil! remain in Now York.
As long as they are going to get it any?
way they are. far from heinic wrought
up as tu which club will furnish the
delivery wagon.
.luat what unexpected episode or un
looked for denouement will arise to
upset this condition mast remain tem?
porarily in an unanswered condition,
As it stands now th? Yanks burn
picked un the jump and have, proved
their fitness where they were supposed
to be at their worst. But until Babe
Ruth lights the fuse of his tirr-.r, home
run tire leading drama remains some?
what curbed. Those two closing strike?
out.- pleased him almost as much us if
Douglas liad bitten off his loft leg.
Who knows what he may do under such
u nseemly pt ovocation '.'

Room After Their Game
By Jack Lawrence
Babe Ruth '.vas the obscured hero of
yesterday's world series tussle. Th""
Bambusting Babe was a disappoint?
ment to the many thousands who went
to the l'olo Grounds with the con?
fident expectation of seeing him laco
the ball to some distant quarter for a
fleck of spectacular honre runs.
Home run hitters and humorists are
subject to the experience which the
Habe suffered yesterday. Mark Twain
was always expected to say something
excruciatingly funny and Babe Ruth
is always expected to make a home
rue. There is a lot oi intolerance
shown when humorists and home-run
hitters drop back to what in them if
considered mediocrity^
Ruth'- role yesterday was over?
shadowed by the sparkling brilliance of
Roger Peckinpaugh, Aaron Ward, Mike
McNally and Walter i'ipp. An old
baseball fan raid to the writer yester?
day that this infield could be the best
und the worst in the world. Yesterday
it was the best. Tho inner defense of
the Yanks made the infield of the
Giants look dull and drab and
tarn i 'nod. The same veteran fan said
that when the Yanks ??re ""going right""
and working behind real pitching they
re] ? ?ont an almost unbcatiible ball
ib That va: the case yesterday.
Y\ bat Hoggin? Thinks
After the game, when ""ic' Yanks
wort disrobing joyously in theii -luffj
little quarters behind th? cheapest
bleacher seats, the writer sought oui
Miller Muggins, the smallest t>tg leagui
manager ir: the world, and asked hin
what he thought about, the proceedings
Huggins was in his underwear, prepar
ing to take a shower bain. His line?
and drawn face reflected unspcakabl?
weariness. He said he was too tire?
to tail'.. lie looked like, a man wh<
had just finished a triple trick in th?
first-lir.e troncb.es. In answer to th?
question he raised a haggard and care
worn face.
""Well,*' he said slowly, ""the low-dowi
on tho situation is that Carl .Hay
pitched a hell of a ball game and thi
boys played like hell behind him. Yoi
Can't beat that stuff the Yankee
showed you to-day. The way they wer
rolling they would have beaten niv
ball club in the world, and I guess Johi
McGraw would be the firsr. to admit, it
The Yanks won on their merits. Ther
can be r.o question about that. May
started with a lot of stuff and got. bet
ter as the game went along. ? thin
lie was stronger in the ninth than h
was in the first.
""What impressed me most about t:;
gam? ? That's cas; . It was the ; anV
spirit. There has been an impressio
about town that the Yanks win on!
when their long distance hitters ai
clouting the ball. In other wordi
there are a lot of people who thin
that we win bail games because w
can't help it. 1 think to-day's gam
disproved that dope. We won becaus
the Yanks played about as stcrlin
a brand of baseball as ever- v, as sin
in a world's series. 1 think we her.
the Giants at their own game.
Both Deine red. Says ""Hug""
R ith? Was hi a disappointment
1 ?horrid say r ot. If you will look ov?
t ,o .-.- ore card you will ee that it w;
the Babe's hit. hut cien n cul ing
?i Lh< :' r ?? ini ng, thai scored I he i??,
that beat th? Giants. .'. things turne
out, that single was as bi? as a hon
run to us, although it may have seem?
disanpointins to the crowd.
""Then you niu?-t remember that tl
Babe played a great game in the frei
The catches he made out there in le
looked easy, but at that particular tin
in tho afternoon, with the sun glarii
into a player's eyes, that field is tl
toughest in either- league. The Bal
didn't slain out any home runs, hut 1
played his game, and played it well,
did all the rest of the team.
""I hope that McNally's steal in tl
fifth inning won't be regarded as ;
unfair decision ?'ir the par! of Umpi
Rigleiv Snyder misjudged the -peed
which Mike was heading for tl""- pial
and didn't pul the ball on sun un
Ik had shot half way across.""
Huggins would say nothing about !
plans for t o-day.
'""-o us? a-king me that now,""
said, ""I've got to have a little time
think the situation over. You kne
how i? is. But you can shv thi; f
mo: The Yanks will be out ther? I

bowed this afternoon. Wc arc go)

of Frank I- rlsch, the magnificent t hi
nan, ai the ma instay of t

""Great ball plnyei. I hat boy,"" ti
the Yxrik manager. ""We ought to
t
I one of the best mi the business in a
I year or so. He's fast ;ird has got the
right; idea about hitting.""
McNally, who was the outstanding
j hero of yesterday's encounter, Avas
j quite positive about what happened
| in the fifth inning when he stele
; home from third base and was declared
I safe over the fervid protests of the
? entire Giant infield. Eo say nothing of
! a horde of McGraw's men who dashed
cut of the dugout.
When he was questioned last night
by tire writer a? he was sponging off
the stain of battle, Mike, viro is a
diffident, sort of a kid, corroborated
very largely what Miller Huggins hail
said, and he added the important in?
formation that the steal was under?
taken entirely on his own initiative
and said that no signalled order for
it hod eotne from the bench,.
McNally Sure)}' Traveled
McNally was the lirst man up in the
fifth inning, and there Avere two stri-;r
and two balls called on him when hi
doubled sharplj to left. Wally Scbang
sacrificed him alone; to third. Mays
struck out and Douglas was just v rind
in g up to hurl the tirst. ball to Eli ei
Miller, the next up, when Mike started.
He came down the trail like a !'rie;ht
tened deer, a flying shadow. Tl
whs a hit wide and pulled Snyder to
the right of the plate. The catcher,
however, was slow in acting after he
finally had the bail in his hand, and
when he finally touched McNally (.hi:
latter was sliding across.
""I could feel the plate under mo
when Snydei touched me,"" said Mc?
Nally last night. ""From where he was
standing, after having taken Douglas
pitch, it would have been impossible
for him to tac; mo out befoi'e rnj feel
slid across the plate. II"" was too Car
ove r.""
The Yankee dressing room afti the
game presented a seen-' that w ??? ? .
far from what mignt have bcei ex?
pected. There wasrri any wild jub la
tion. The boj were a- quiet a though
they had just finished a gam vith a
minor league club on a spring training
trip. The only outburst of etitliusia m

of the owner; of tho club, when he
rushed into the crnmped quarters to

""It was hue. boys!"" exclaimed the

Two thousand were gathered in : ic

in his street clothes he was greeted
with cheers. A mob escorted Ruth

noon, the Giants will return to the
lists to-da; . determined to redeem '
themselves and put the series on an
even basis before nightfall. The
Giants did not play their usual high
class brand of ball and none, realizes
that fact any better than the players
themselves. They were plainly oif
form, but they promise to flash a <!'v<-'
enl Bort of performance th s afternoon.
Tl ?."" was no dejected lot of players
in the lubhouse aftei the contest, but
their fighting pirit hi now been
thoroughly aroused. They talker,' not

""We have invariably played poorly

By Fred Hawthorne
It was 1 o'clock at the Polo Grounds
yesterday and not an actor in the press
borr. ""Tiny"" Maxwell, of Philadelphia,
perspired through the irrite and occu?
pied three seats. Not an ?olor in sight
yet!
At tritt o'clock the teams i rted
warming up. At that time tho ?':.r,<is
were only partly tilled. Bob Shawkey,
who, the man on our right said, was
;i pitcher, began to heave them over the
plate. Habe Bambino Ruth stepped up
and smashed the first ball right on the

ride clear over the licld and int?
right hand bleachers. Then '
voice;: vent ""Bla-a-a!"" and Babe pulled'
a couple of trick bows.
It's ever so much rougher than a
lawn tennis tournament ! As we entered
the stands and started for the p ess
box some practical joker on the Giant
team hit a foul ball that flew seven?
teen stories into the air and then did
an Isaac Newton to the basement. It
beaned an ?33nocent bysitter roundly
on the top *it tin- head. Sympathetic
hands gathered him up and laid the
remains tenderly back in tho seat. Ten
minute ? later, in his ante-mortem state?
ment, th? victim said: ""Bclievini I , ..

eum -i Hida\ it to the effect, ; : lha!
r he ofli? ia '. league ball now in use has

it's solid lead.""
At 1:30 o'clock Louis Mann, on the
third desperate assault, crashed his
way through the press gate and started
to pul i an ?mita tioti of "" ?I >;: ; n

Twenty minutes before the garni bo

In tir^ seventh inning the crowd
stood Up and took a stiel oh. tin
Yankee rooters rising Oral and tin
Giant sympathizers climbing to theii
feet afterward. This ? tandil g

Hylan paraded across the field, bead?

of the Governor's!

""You want to duck your bead when

ball clean through our fuselage,"" said
one of the voices from the gky.
""Suppose you think that guy Frisch

ami then the bum of the propeller
smothered the rest of th ? conversation,
was heavily tinged with gaso?

fifth inning the aero-', is jailed ovi -

were hoping ""cloud checks"" would be

The speedy attack and the stros g de?
fensive work that carried the Giants
from the depths to the championship of
the National League were no! in evi?
dence yesterday. The ordinarily steady
Bancroft was far from his usual form.
He scorned to be laboring undo'- I
tense strain of the battle, and he an
peared nervous anil uncertain of
self. A line catch by George Kelly
saved Bancroft fron: one error, and the
kindness of the official scorer prevented
him from being charged with an?
Frank Snyder also showed up poorly on
the defense, and the h*.g catch? i seem rd
utterly at sea. He should I nail
McNally at the plate in the fifth inn
ing when the latter stole home, and
again in the ninth only a great st ip o:
his wild throw by Frisch stopped an
other Yankee fron-, crossing the plate
Time and again the 'liants had op?
portunities to score, but. they could
not come through with th? i
hits. Young, Kelly and M?
had at least one cha3ice to dr
runs, but. they were notoriouslj
at the bat.
Frisch Star of Game
The work of tire. Giants, however, i aa
not without its redeeming features, !<
the followers of McGraw*? /?rani can
find much consolation for theit disap

the pitching of Douglas. Strange as it

Rain and Sloppy Track
Giv?e? M udders a Chance;
Bergagliere Wins Race
?paoiai XHapateh .? The Triouue
PIMLrCO, Md? Nov. 9.?Racine
through the rain, en a track which
might have been cut through the
Hackensack meadows, Scrap's, a sur?
prise* package from the Pelican Stable,
captured the Annapolis Handicap, the
feature of an ordinary card hero this
afternoon. The Boy was second, a
iength and a half back, and .eg was
third. Each of the money horses paid
their supporters well. Dry Moon was
loft at the post. .
Twelve thoroughbreds were sched?
uled to go to the post in the six fur?
long dash, but heavy rains made the
track a sea of mud, and half of this
number w#{ scratched. The starting
was wretched in several races this af?
ternoon and the feature was no excep?
tion. The bar.ier failed to work prop?
erly when sprung and the Stoneham
horse was left flat-footed.
The Boy was first to leave, with
Oriole, the favorite, in close attend?
ance, and Serapis third. At th? five
eighths post the pacemaker had a lead
of five lenpths, but when Serapis, which
passed Oriole at the half-mile mark,
made its final bid. The Boy weakened
and the Pelican Stable meal-ticket
the faltering leader in the stretch, win?
ning easily.
Bersagliere, with C. Summer up, was
made the favorite in the opener and
ied the field of eleven maidens over
the six furlong route. The form p'ay
ers scored again in the Elkridge Stee?
plechase when Phoenix and Sobripade
ran one-two for the Pavis-Dosoris Sta?
ble. Vulcanize, a well played choice
of the majority, led the procession in

University Harriers
In Race Here Saturday
Columbia will act as the host to the
cross-country teams of Dartmouth,
Penn and Cornell for a quadrangular
cross-country run over the Van C-->rt
\landt six-mile course on Saturday.
1 Each of the four teams has listed more
than ten men to start in the chase.
Cornell seems to be the favorite for
the event. The Ithacans will be led by
Captain Carter and will include Nor
.man P. Brown, Robert E. Brown and
George Miske, who lnished with Carter
in a quadruple tie for premier honors
at the Svracuse invitation meet staged
?two weeks ago. Milton E. Richman,
who finished fifth in the upstate run,
will also be a member of the Ithacans'
team. ^

Two Songs of the Field
l?November 10, 1918
The wind is hushed?but the gxens are singing
""Over the top! On down the field!
On ivith the drive! Where life is bringing
*The thrill Huit comes from the sword and shield!""
""Over the top! And on to the cliarge!
On and on through the red barrage! ,
We've cleared the road?that is red and wet-?
We've opened the way for the bayonet!
We've sowed to the wind?noiv reap the crop!
Over the top, now?over the top!""
2?November 10, 1921
The guns are hushed?but the wind is singing
""Sleep forever beneath the field.
On with your dreams, where death is bringing'
The peace that foliovis the sword and shield.
""Under the top of the crust tliat kneio
The thud of your feet when the guns got through.
Home, where the long, long trail is over,
Leading into a land of dreams,
Where poppies send from the fragrant clover
A last Godspeed from the silent streams.""
Bill Kenyon, Georgetown's fullback, is highly recommended by com?
petent experts aa one of the great backs of the year, with Flavin, his
running mate, romping at his side. Thus the complications grow. Star
by star the crop increases.
Watching O'Hearn
If Charley O'Hearn, Yale's quarterback, comes up to complete ex?
pectations he will be the main find of the campaign. O'Hearn has weight,
power, skill, speed and courage. He can kick, pass and run. Weighing
over 170 pounds, he looks to be one of the hardest running backs of the
year.
It is now mainly a question as to how he will show in the first big
November test of his career. If he carries through he will step out as a
star, meaning a wonderful lot to Yale football?not only this season but
for two more years.
""Enter Webster, of Colgate, as another wonder,"" writes Observer.
""On a stronger team ho would be rated as one of the greatest.""
Miss Leitch vs. Miss Hollina
""Can Miss Leitch drive a longer ball than Miss Hollina, the American
champion?"" asks P. M. H.
In their match at Turnbury, Scotland, Miss Hollins was from five
to ten yards, on the average, beyond Miss Leitctu
In their matches over here?including the same competitions where:
they did not meet?Mis3 Hollins was fully as far as the long driving
English girl.
Miss Hollins has even greater physical power than Miss Leitch has.
""She is stronger in her wrists and hands than any other women I ever :
saw,"" says Jim Barnes, open champion. ""And I believe she can drive a
longer ball than any other woman in the game.""
Comparative Power
Barnes in his match showed how much longer a man can drive than
any woman.
Meeting Miss Leitch, the open champion was over 60 yards beyond
the hard hitting English girl upon the average. On one or two holes he
was close to 100 yards beyond.
At one of the long holes, for example, around 530 yards, Miss Leitch
needed a drive, a brassie and a mashie to get home and collect her par 5,
On the same hole Barnes got home with a drive and a full iron, picking
up an eagle 3.
I Another duel worth observing on Saturday will be the rival display of
j Keck and Into, two of the star'tackles of the day. Tackles rarely compete
j in any direct fashion, but at least their comparative merits can be better
? judged when they are at work on the same field. Keck has already had
some rare competition. He found himself on the same field with two great
tackles in King a^d Bolles, of the Navy. He found himself on the same field
with another great tackle in McGuire, of Chicago, who is rated by many
as the best tackle the East has seen all year. He will meet another star in
Into, who is big, strong, fast and aggressive. With Lourie facing O'Hearn,
Keck involved indirectly with Into, and with other problems to be unrolled'
on that day, the Ytle-Princeton game will be a big factor in deciding
the ultimate status of several notable personages in the football realm. S
?* Roberts Beats Crossley
AI Roberts, Staten Island's heavy?
weight, earned the judge's decision
over Bert Crossley, who recently came
over from England, in a slow twelve
round bout at the Pioneer A. C. last
night. Crossley was somewhat better
than his countrymen who have recently
tried to gather a bit of coin at the
expense of the local fighters, and al?
though the affafr was by no means
one-sided, Roberts was clearly en?
titled to the decision. The weight?
were 188 for Roberts and 180 for
Crossley.

In Amateur Bout
Gorsky Uses Uppercut to
Advantage in a Fast
Session in Garden Ring
Harry Gorsky, of the Pastime A. C,
outpointed Ed Riley, the clever little
negro boxer of the St. Christopher
Club, in a fast three-round bout at
Madison Square Garden last night,
where the A. A. U. amateur tournament
came to a close. Gorsky proved a will?
ing mixer and a good uppercut found
its mark often. Riley appeared tired
from his earlier efforts in the semi
fin I3 and did not show his usual speed,
Barney Rosenkranz, unattached,
scored a sensational knockout after
fortyreight seconds of fighting in the
first round, when he connected with
George Fox's unprotected chin and
lifted the latter off hi3 feet. Fox hit
the canvas head first and was out for
five minutes. Before Fox made the
journey to dreamland he displayed lots
of gamoneas.

Sharkey Gets Last Chance
At Championship in Garden
West Side Challenger and
New Title Holder Sched?
uled to Box 15 Rounds
After flirting a long time with the
bantamweight title, Jack Sharkey will
get another chance for the crown at
Madison Square Garden to-night, when
he clashes with Johnny Buff, the pros?
ont champion.
Sharkey is, perhaps, the foremost
contender for the laurels now worn by
Buff, and the champion is certain to
have a real battle on his hands when
he faces the sturdy and clever Italian
over the fifteen-round trail at Tex
Rickard's big arena.
When Buff dethroned Pete Herman
about five weeks ago the new title
holder promised Rickard that he would
meet any one, at any time, in a cham?
pionship bout at the Garden, and
Rickard has chosen Sharkey as the
most formidable opponent for Buff,
At one time, not so long ago, Sharkey
was among the most brilliant perform?
ers in this class, but there was a sad
lapse from form and many of the
critics doubted whether the little WeBt
Side lad could ever regain his former
ring cleverness.
Those who have seen Sharkey dur?
ing his recent season of intensive
training uro unanimous in their be?
lief that he has returned to the con?
dition which made him such a fine
performer. Jack is primed for the final
test and he knows full well that if he
fails to-night he may never get an?
other cliance at the title. .
Weigh In at 118 Pounds
Both boys will weigh in at 118 pounds
at 2 o'clock this afternoon. When they
ended their training activities yester?
day Sharkey tipped the beam at 117,
while Buff weighed 114%.
""I feel even better than the night I
won from Herman,"" said Johnny yes?
terday. ""When I'm fit I always feel
sure of winning, and there is no douht
about how I will feel to-morrow night.""
Sharkey was most prominent a little
over a year ago, when he defeated
Jimmy Wilde, the Englishman, at Mil?
waukee. He also met Pete Herman, Joe
Lynch and all the ether boxers of
prominence in the bantam class, and
then, when the title appeared to be in
his gTasp, he displayed a sudden re
! versal of form.
| In the preliminaries Larry Regan will
' meet Charlie Ryder; George, one of the
three Shade brothers, will clash wi?*""h
Bert Colima, and Joe Tiplitz boxes
Johnnie Drummie.
Jimmy Duffy, West Side, lightweight,
will engage Willie Thompson, of Green
point, at the weekly boxing tourna?
ment of the Ridgewood Sporting Club,
Erooklyn, Saturday niorht. The contest
is scheduled for twelve rounds. In
another twelve-rounder Tommy Elm
and Willie Crystal will meet Two six
round battles also are on the card. ?
Zbyszko and Lewis Will
Clash at Garden Nov. 25
Stanislaus Zbyszko, world's cham?
pion wrestler, will defend his title
against Ed ""Strnngler"" Lewis at Madi?
son Square Garden on November 28.
After a conference lasting several
days the managers of both men met
at the Garden yesterday with match?
maker George Bothner and promoter
Tex Rickard, agreeing to terms and
the posting of forfeits.
Rickard, who is offering a $2,500 belt
to the winner of Monday night's con?
test between Ple?tina and Pesek, will
present a diamond studded helt to the
winner of the championship match.
Lewis lost the title to Zbyszko last
winter in twenty-six minutes.
Green Scores Knock-Out
Johnny Green, the Harlem bantam?
weight, knocked out Jack Cordy, of the
West Side, in the fifth round of their
scheduled ten-round bout at the Hunt's
Point A. C, last night.

Of Babe Ruth Case
On Questionnaire
Recalcitrant Yankees Must
Answer on Barnstorming
Tour; Decision NextWeek
CHICAGO, Nov. 9. ? Judge Landis,
commissioner of baseball, intends to
dispose of the cases of Babe Ruth
and the other two members of the
pennant winning Yankee3 who violated
baseball laws by participating in ex?
hibitions, so soon as he hears what
the offending players have to S3y for
themselves. Indications to-day were
that the deceision may bo expected be?
fore the end of the week.
Leslie O'Connor, secretary of the
baseeball commission, said that a ques?
tionnaire had been sent to Ruth, Bob
Meusel and Bill Piercy, which would
give them a chance of explaining their
violation of the major league constitu?
tion, but that no reply had been re?
ceived from any of them.
""Judge Landis will not give the de?
cision in these cases until he hears
from the players,"" Secretary O'Connor
said, ""or unless he fails to hear from
them within a reasonable time.""
?The questions asked by Judge Landis
in the questionnaire to the player;
have not been made public, but it if
said they are in the nature of at
examination, as the commissioner de?
sires to know what influences could
have prevailed upon the trio to disrc
gard the laws in the face of the warn
ing given them before they started or
their barnstorming trip.
BOSTON, Nov. 9.?Babe Ruth sai<
that he had mailed his answer to Judg<
Landis's questionnaire regarding hi
participation in the post-season barn
storming tour. He thought it woulc
reach Chicago by to-morrow. Ruth de
clined to discuss the nature of hi:
answer, other than to say that h<
hoped it will be satisfactory. He sai<
he had not yet received his worlt
series money.

OF HIS PLANS FOR
YEARS 10 COME
Bambino Declares Confidently
He Is Good for Ten
k Years More.
UUST BEGUN, HE SAYS
f King of Swat Will Again Break
Record Despite Suspen
sion, He Promises.
HOT SPniNGS, Ark., March 9
(Copyright. 1922). OcorBO Herman
Kuth, High Priest of Swat, docs not
consider that an Income surpasslnB
that of the President of the United
States by any means represents the
ultlmato worth of a real baseball star.
Therefore, when his present flvo
Voar half-mllllon-dollar contract ex
pires ho wilt bo out thoro on the fir
ing line fl&htlng It out, or tossing it
out, with the two Colonels who own
tho New York Yankees to seo 'Just
i what tho next big salary boost will be.
It will all depend upon how much
: money tho battling Babe has drawn
""tit tho gato during tho next five sea
sons and Just how far he, steers from
tho iro of Judge Landls. Babo de
clared to-day that hereafter ho was
""a business man."" Tho two Colonels
agreed with him.
Just before leaving for Now Orleans
(o-day to Join the main Yankee squad,
Ruth consented for tho first time to
say omethlng about his new status
as the highest salaried man ever
known to tho national gamo, as well
as something about his prospects of
the noxt few years.
Ituth believes that he Is Just enter
ing the domain of l)lg accomol sh
menta. When his present extraor
dinary contract expires In 1926 ho will
bo thirty-three years old. By that
time he feels ho -will havo established
such a stnndardlied output of home
runs that he can keep it up in
definitely. If confidence Is half the battle, Babe
already has most of the American
league pitchers headed for the
showers and Is on his way to making
n mighty den tin tho Yankee Colonels'
bankroll atho rato of $500 for every
fnur-THLSO clout.
""Why man, I'm Just beginning to
bat,"" he said to-day, unconsciously
varaphraslng his greot navai proio
tvnn. John Paul Jones.
Quess ril have a lato start this
year all right,"" ho continued with a
crln, ""so I won't put a number on
ihe home runs, but I will mako more
!mn Jast year, and keep on making
more.""
Buoyant -with youth, riding the top
wave of ipopularlty, confident that he
lias not ncarcd tho pinnacle of his
career, tho Babo nevertheless had n
lark half-hour to-day. Somo one
brought up tho subject of the Income
lax and began to figure thligs out
for the Bambino. ""Business man'
that he li, Babo needs a little help at
""flggers"" now and then.
So his killjoy friend with the pencil
i ctuctantly convinced Ruth that every
tunc ho knocks a homo run In 1921!
he will havo to pay to his Undo Ham
something like $166.33. In other
Words, If the present rate of tncomo
lex keeps up, and the unhappy pros
lxicts are that It will, the United
States Treasury will grab off JuBt
nlcmt one-third of every dollar that
Itabo Ruth makes during the rfcxt
live years.
""Guess Til havo to 'bust' out more
of 'cm than I thought I would,"" said
(ho Babe scratching his head in an
tiltemnt at real Uocd thouitht.
Babe Ruth was asked If he thotight
other ballplayers were worth salaries
Hiiproxlmatlng his own. Ho evaded
comparisons, but Raid:
""A man ought to get whnt he can
en in. Don't mako any difference
whether It's running n farm, running
it bank or running a show, u man
who knows he Is making money for
other people ought to get some of the
profit he brings In. it's business, I
tell you; there nin't no sentiment to
It. Forget that stuff.""
""What are you going to do with
all your money?"" Babe was asked.
""I've got five big years of baseball
ahead of me now, and I guess I'll
have five moro after that. Whrt'a
the use o going further along than
that? I haven't ever thought of quit-
ling tho game. I feel as If I was Just
ntnrtlng In to begin. Course, bam
mil is different from anything elx?.
Look at those birds sitting across the

Rutli has a reason for saying that.
Ho Is Interested In tho scientific side
of sport nnd has been studying omo

havo shown his entire body In ac
tion during tho stroke. Ruth's swing
s not a perfect one, from tho pro
fessional golfer's point of view. The
camera shows him upon both toes
ns ho hits tho ball. That Is ""bad golf
form"" but It tells something of tho
lilducn power behind tho fcat the

Yunkecs to Now Orleans to-day,

V THE EVENING WORLD, SATURDAY, JULY 15, 192a.
WALTER HAQEN PUTS AMERICA ON WORLD'S GOLF PINNACLE
NEW BRITISH CHAMPION
. RARE TOE OF FIGHTER
How Hagen, Native New YorRer, Changed His Game to Meet
Different Conditions in England and Finally Met With Success.
By Robert Edgren.
Walter Hagen Is a fine type of the
fighting golfer. He has long been
famous for his ability to ""como from
behind"" In a hard match. He Is a
strong finisher. He has streaks when
his golfing ability wanes, but after
. whllo be comes back better than
ver.
When Hagen won the British Open
Championship on Juno 23d he put
America squarely on tho golf map.
For many years It has been generally
believed that, while American amu
leurs might possibly win on raro oc
casions from British amateurs, the
American - bred professionals never
could well compare with the' British
Pi on.
For many yea is Americans were
outclassed when they visited Kngland
and competed In the British Open
Championship, and their failure to
win or even malto a good showing
was ascribed to the high winds and
hard fairways of tho seaside courses
In England, as well as to tho superior
brand of golf developed In England
by these hindrances.
Last year ""Jock"" Hutchison broko
tho hoodoo by winning the British
Open. But In England any chagrin
that might have been felt when tho
cup travelled across seas was tossed
off with the remark that Hutchison
was born near St. Andrews In Scot
land, even if he WAS a naturalized
citizen of the United States.
When Jim Barnes won tho United
States Open Championship, with
England's best professionals compet
ing. It was pointed out that Barnes
was really an Englishman by birth.
TRY AND TRY AGAIN.
But Walter Hagen is American
born, and his golf was developed on
Ameilcan courses.
His victory was backed by Barnes
and Hutchinson. Barnes tied with
George Duncan of England for second
place, and Hutchinson took fourth, so
that the American team took three of
the first four places. The scores were
Close, being 300, 301 and 302.
Hagen It persistent. This was his
tlilrd attempt to win the British Open.
Afteij winning tho American Open
Championship in 1914 and again In
1919, Hugen travelled to England In
1920 as American champion, md was
thought to havo a fairly good chance
to win. He played several brilliant
preliminary matches on Inland
courses but when he went dow nto the
championships at the Royal Cinque
I'orts Golf lub at l.eal, where the
wind blows bo hard that the natives
can't grow whickers, he flopped com
pletely, failed to break eighty"" In any
ot his tour rounds, and finished In
fifty-fifth position. Hagen said at the
time that the heavy winds wrecked
his game. Ho had no shuts in his
bag to offset them.
But here is where Hagen's per
sistency comes in. Returning to
America he played all over tho East
ern and Southern part of the coun
try, especially looking for breezy sea
side courses. Ho studied every shot
that should be played against and
across a heavy wind, and perfected
low, hard drives and brassle shots
and runnlng-up approaches. Hagen
uses rather light clubs. He driver
weigh 13 ounces. Hut he hits tre
mendous ball with either wood or
iron.
In the British Open Hagen played
with perfect confidence. He knew
how to meet the local conditions. Hib
driving and approaches were perfect
and confidence on the greenB made
him putt his best all through the
match. Only once wan Hagon out of
the lead for tho moment, when
Hutchinson shot a 73 In the third
round and passed him. But Walter
ramo right back with a 72 In the
final round, showing that as usual he
could make a fighting finish under
pressure.
Hagen Is a Now Torkoi ,' bl ought
up at Rochester, he started as a pro
fessional In his home town. After
ward he went to Detroit. He won
tho National Open In 1914. In 191r
he performed one of tho startling
feats that made him famous. It was
In the Panama-Pacific Exposition In
ternational Tournament on the old
Ingles'do oourse'. Coming through to
Iho final, Hagen met John Black, one
of the greatest Western golfers and
n tromendous driver. Knowing thit
niack would press him hard Hagtn
ptarted with apparent recklessness,
smashing into tho ball for great dis
tances from the tee, yet playing every
Mint so perfectly that ho scored 29
on tho first nine holes of the flnai
round, which gave lilm a winning
I'ad. As Frank Peebles, the famous
Coast professional, described It,
""Hagen was a tornado from the first
tee and nothing could stand In his
v.-sy ""
An a- professional Walter was al
ways a great favorite with the ladles,
not only because of his golf, but be
cause he Is a ""classy drespcr."" nival
professionals call him the ""Beau
Brummel of the profession.""
Hagen has already told the Ens
llsh people that he hopes to bring the
cup back and defend It next year,
lie has as rood a chance to repeat as
any man that ever won a champion
ship. Jock Hutchinson came near
turning the trick only two strokes
behind tho winner to 302.
Hagen Is a man of medium height,
compactly built. He has neither the
lanky make-up of Long Jim Barnes
nor the beef of a Vardon nor a Ray.
But ho can hit a travelling ball with
any of them. His start in nnnrt -wn
as a baseball player. Found hitting
a goir ball more fun. He has had
plenty of experience in championship
play. Bcsldo winning the National
Open In 1914 and 1919, he won the
Western Open In 1916 and was close
second to Jim Barnes In 1917. That
ho goes off his gamo llko any other
golfer Is Indicated by the fact that he
finished seventh In tho Western Open
In 1919. Barnes wlnnlnir. with nio.i
and Hutchison second and third. In
the North and South Championship
the same year at Plnehurst, Hagen
shot a brilliant last round, being two
under fours to the last hole, where
he needed a four to win. He got off
a fine drive, dubbed approach shots,
and finally missed a three-foot putt,
taking a 6. In the recent North and
South Championship he finished In
ninth place .with a 302, tied with Joo
Klrkwood. A year before he lost the
North and South Championship by a
stroke, scaring 294 to Fred McLeod's
J93. In match play outside the cham
pionship meets Walter is usually a
dangerous finisher. In an Individual
match with Barnes at New Orleans,
when Barnes had been touring tho
country and was playing at the top
of his form, Hagen beat the national
champion on the thirty-seventh hole,
after winning the thirty-sixth for a
tie. Hagen and Alec Smith beat
Barnos and Robertson 2 and 1.

SCHEDULE GIVES BROWNS
ADVANTAGE OVER YANKEES
St. Louis Team Has Twenty
More Games With Second
Division Clubs.
With the help of one Mr. Schedule,
the St. Louis Browns hope to win
tho American League pennant. Just
before Lee Fohl and his company put
out for Washington after losing two
out of three in the ""crucial Berfes""
with the Yanks, the leader of the
Browns voiced his prospects with
""Ijok at the schedule.""
Without going into an intricate
bunch of figures, the schedule shows
that the Browns have about twenty
more games with the second division
clubs than tho New York Yanks have
In the last lap of the race. While the
Yanks arc scheduled to battle with
lubs that always give them trouble,
tho Browns have comparatively easy
meat.
""Don't pay any attention to that
hot weather stuff In St. Louis either,""
i-'ohl said.
From the form shown by both clubs
in tho series Just closed It looks as If
it should be a real fight clear down to
the last day of the season. The
Browns are now leading by one-half
LINART VICTOR
IN MOTOR PACED
BICYCLE RACE
Behind the roar of hla sputtering
pacer, while a crowd of 12,000 cheered,
Victor Ltnart won the one hour Inter
national motor paced team race at th
New York Velodrome last night. With
his partner, Paul Verkyn, he covered
forty-one miles and three-quarters of
a lap In the one hour of riding, and
scored flfty-slx points. Five points
went to the team leading at tho end
of every five miles. Llnart won all the
c!""'? fer his te&rn.
Clarence Carmen and George Wiley
were second. They covered forty-one
miles and twenty yards and had thirty
six points. Carmen, the American
champion, like Llnart, won all the
,olnts for his team.
Carmen and Llnart fought a bitter
duel from the crack of the gun. At the
thirty-eighth mile mark Ltnart lapped
the American, but by a great burst ot
speed Curmcn regained It. He wa
too far behind on points to win the
race. Seres, the French champion, and
hla little partner were completely out
classed, Although the former lost most
nt his distance by getting a puncture
in the early stages of the race.
. Francisco Verrl, the Italian flyer, won
two heats In the four cornered ma tel.
race, but Bobble Wallhour Jr., son oi
the famous Dixie flyer of a score ol
years ago, forced him to his best
efforts. Verrl won the first and third
heats, and Walthour the second brush.
Tills race was run on the point system.
Vem had 11 points. Walthour 8, Mc
Namara 6 and Hans Ohrt of Call
fornla 3.
Eddie Madden and Cecil Walker were
defeated In the one mile team match
I ace. Plant, the Italian, and Goullet.
beat them In two straight heats. Kalsei
did not ride with Madden last night,
having been suspended by the Cycling
Association for Indifferent riding in
Newark last Sunday.
Freddie Bpsocsr defeated bis greatest
game and they are showing no signs
ot slipping. The pitchers are working
well, and Sister and Williams are -t
great pair of ball players. The one
weakness that may got the Browns In
trouble Is the lack of good reserve
material.
If tho Yanks change any at all,
they should get better. The ""Five
Star"" pitching staff ought to improve
if anything nnd if Babe Ruth ever
gets started, the New Yorks will be a
mighty hard club to beat.
From the all Important tempera
mental standpoint, the Browns look
better. Fohl laughed when asked
about the recent stories that the club
was battling Internally and ho Insisted
that ho didn't have anything thai
looked llko a family fuss.
Both clubs have a lot of power nnd
It seems that victory will come to the
pilot who gets the most out of his
material. When It comes to this, the
Browns should be the favorites on
past performances.
Tho Yanks have tho most power
ful club In the league and they should
bo way out In front If they behave,
but they don't Fecm to be able to get
going together consistently.
The Browns are a dangerous club
to trifle with and If Manager Hug
gins can't persuade his athletes to
get busy on basebull alone, the pen
nant will trickle right out ot their
hands.
rival, Willie Grimm. In tho one mile
open amateur. Spencer nipped Grimm
at the finish and won by a proverbial
hair's breath. Tho time for this raci
was 1 minute 59 4-5 seconds. Willie
Fenn Jr., son of the famous old timer,
won the half mile handicap. The one
mile novice was won by James Plsclattu
und the two mile lap amateur went to
Earl Adams.
WESTCHESTER DOUBLES
FINALS TO-MORROW
J. D. Ewlng and R. Stoddard reached
the final round of the Westchester
County lawn tennis doubles champion
ship on the courts of the County Tennth
Club of Westchester at Hartadale. They
defeated Vanderbllt B. Ward and R. C.
Watklns by a score of 64, 7 6.
In the rallies of thfs seml-flnal round
encounter Ewtng and Stoddard by tho
strength of their net attack carried the
clofcely fought games. The second set
went deuce at 6-all. Ward's forehand
drives found the mark for the openings
at this period, but steadiness on the
part of Ewlng and Stoddard finally

Events of Week at Yonkers
Dispel Idea That Racing
Thrives on ""Sure Things""
Defeat of Rork Just Another
Instance Marinelli Or
der Rescinded.
By Vincent Trcnnor.
NOTHING is cut nnd dried on tho
rnco tracks nowadays. Kvents
of the past week, tho first of
the meeting at Yonkers, havo amply
proved this. Sure things and their
operators arc things of tho pust, us
far as racing la concerned, If Indeed
they ever existed. Every onco in a
whllo a condition nrlses that suggests
manipulating, but It Ih rnrely seen
through to u successful end.
Tho last ovent at the Hmpliu
Track yesterday furnished nn In
stance which should dlsprovo quickly
any belief that rnclng Is not con-1
ducted fairly and squarely. Itork thn 1
favorite, nnd rlddon by Knr! Saiulo
penerally regarded tho best of present I
time Jockeye, looked an reasonably
suro n winner on past performances, '
us nny horso could appear. Tho i
principal contention tho entries prom-'
Ised was scratched whon Peter
Hrown, Cork Kim and Scarecrow were
emong tho tlx withdrawals. j
To tho betting fraternity It seemed
a cose of ""putting It down nnd taking
It up."" It was little wonder that
Rork was tnado n hot favorite nnd
Trainer Willie Shields and Ownor J.
L. Holland couldn't bo blamed for
thinking that at Iftht Roik hud struck
n ""soft spot.""
Aftor tho barrier went up and Hondo
shot Rork to the front, the two-year
gelding looked the next thing to u
certainty. He galloped In tho lend
and at one time- was three lengths in
front of the nearest contender. Kven
In the stretch Rork was maintaining
his early advantage with little dldl-

culty. ""He was home,"" as tho race
goers say when a horso Is so far In
front nnd tho finish so close by, but
suddenly there was a closing behind
him. Uesale Lelghton began moving
fiom the second division of the field.
""She can't catch Ilork now,"" cried
the backers of the latter and It didn't
soem us If she could uftor making
such a game try. Within n toss of a
stone to the wlro, .Sonde scented dan
ger. He pulled his whip. Tho move
ment was hardly completed when
Itcsslo Lelghton wns beside Rork, and
going further with ono stride than he
was with two. It takes time to tell It,
but not nearly so long for IIcs.ilc
Lelghton to shoot In front of Rork und
then tho rnco wns over.
l-'or a minute the crowd, or that
part of It which had depended on
.Simile und Rork to save the day for
them, wore shocked, but only for a
minute. They were soon headed for
the gates and home, convinced once
again that tho best thing about rac
ing Is to be sure there Is no such ani
mal us a sure thing.
Tho track ut Empire uoa too lien,
cherous for wise speculators. It wus
muddy nt both rails and drying out
in tho middle. Jockeys steered their
mounts ten feet from tho Inner rail
In search of good going, and accord
Ingly tho time recorded wns slow In
every race. Thero was no such
Jockey trick us saving giound on the
lull, and tho few Instances where
riders tried this they found them
selves In a mucilage like substance
that stopped their mounts dead. To
day the truck should be In good con
dition for the holiday racing prom
ised. I
Jockey Marinelli Is In good stand
Ing again. The stewards have re
sclnded their recent order suspend
ing him und referring his cuso to
the Jockey Club because his badge
wan presented at tho g; by some
body but himself. The h. had done
no real harm to rnclng so the deci
sion reflecting on him seemed foolish
In the first pluce.
Taylor, the apprentice boy who gvt
Rravo home In front of Lord Herbert
and AJgoa, fooled tho more experi
enced Pool and Fator, who rodo tin
chplces. Ho stole a long lead at th""
beginning, and they took their tlcip
about going after him, believing he
would ""como back"" to thoni. When
thoy finally gathered around him
nearlng the stretch turn, Pool and
Fator figured Bravo was done, nnu
thoy delayed their finishing run In
stead of coming on about their busi
ness. Instead of being dono, howcv;i
the kid rider apparently had somo
thing up his sleeve. Bravo had an
othor run left In him and It carried
him safely homo. Hobby Smith,
trainer of llravo, had llttlo faith In
the colt's ability to win, no the 7 to 1
against his chance went begging.
Little McNnmee hnd a close call
shortly after the start of tho eecon-'
race when he was unseated from Jo
coso. At first it was thought that
Buxton, who rodo the winner, was re
sponsible for the youngster's fall, but
Investigation placed the blame on the
slippery going. Tho boy, fortunately,
wahn't hurt.

Football Teams of Cornell
And Dartmouth Arrive To-Day
Elevens Meet To-Morrow at
Polo Grounds Officials of
Game Announced.
DARTMOUTH and Cornell foot
ball squads will arrive in New
ter to-morrow ufternoon. Both teams
got a rousing send-off when they de
parted from Ithaca and Hanover. The
contest promises to bo one of the
hardest fought this season on tho Pol
Grounds. Thirty-five players com
prlso tho Green squad and thlrty
thno nre on tho Ithaca roster.
Dartmouth has won twice froir
Cornell under tho 'new system on thi
Polo Grounds by which New York
City Is Dartmouth's home Hold. At
Ithaca Dartmouth has been less for
tunate. The scries stands t,.o and
one in favor of Dartmouth.
The officials for the gnme will be
C. J. McCarty, Germantown, referee;
J. C. McDonald, Chicago, umpire; D.
W. Mcrrlman, Geneva, field Judge; A
W. Rlsley. Colgate, linesman.
The Dartmouth cheering section
will bo on the north sldtof the field
About 1,500 undergraduates and col
lege men are expected to arrive tn
Now York from Hanover on special
trains. With the graduates of Nevv
York City, who now number more
than 1.200, Dartmouth will havo a
cheering section of about 4,000.
Tho Cornell cheering section Is on
the south side of the field. Tho atten
dance from Cornell will bo the largest
that ever saw n Cornell game at the
Polo Grounds, and with undergrad
uatoe and all will number more than
12,000. Both teams will be accompa
nied 'by their collego bands.
Tho annual dual glee club concert
will ho helil ut the Hotel Pennsyl
vania to-nglht.
Coach Caunell has driven the Dart
mouth squad t top speed all week In
preparation for tho game.
The psychology of tho game, 'n
Coach Doble's opinion, Is all In favor
of Dartmouth, but there are strong
indications that the gloomy Scot has
worked the Red eleven Up to n satis
factory pitch. Reports of Dartmouth
strength personally given by scouts
have made a deep Impression on t'v
Red and White, and from all Indica
tions Cornell will put a fighting team
on the gridiron Saturday.
SCRUB ELEVEN MAKES
YALE FIGHT FOR SCORE
NEW HAVEN, Conn., Nov. 10. Th
varsity had to work hard to make one
touchdown yesterday against the scrub
team, Wight carrying the ball over Just
before the practice ended.
The aarub played with new strength
because of the return to th line-up of
Wise, the quarterback, who has been
laid up with a bad shoulder for the past
few weeks. With the assistance of
Illcheson, Dahl and fitavenn, he twice
took tho scrub team to the varsity S
yard line. On both occasions the var
elty held the Fcrub for downs.
On a third occasion on a fourth down
on the SO-yard line. Wise dropped buck

New York University Is by playing
at the top of Its game and by get
ting the breaks. Otherwise N. Y. U.
will beat us. They have a much more
experienced team. Tholr men know
more"" football. It Is hard for n team
without at least a year of football
experience to use what footlmll
knowledge It acquires. No matter
how much the players are taught,
they forget It tn a game. But wo
have greatly Improved In the last tw.
weeks. And to-morrow I can expect
the fellows to fight for all their wnrtn.
anyhow.""

chances on losing to C. C. N."" Y. In
spite of the superior record of tils

Every day of ours h a new chapter In the Bible,
Everyfpage will be great to thousands of generations.
We a# those about whom they will say:
The lm:ky ones lived In 1917. .
And you are still shouting: They perish!
You are still whimpering lavishly.
Dunderheads!
Isn’t yesterday crushed, like a dove
By a motor?
Emerging madly from the garage?
TUIE culture of Russia is fresh with a new spirit that
Is significantly contagions. Even a mystical poet
such as Andrey Bely Is affected. Theosophy and sym
bolism become secondary for the moment In the groat
change that has marked the new Russia. Russia be
comes for Bely the new Nazareth. He composes a
cycle of poems, Christ is Arisen, dedicated to the pro
letarian revolution. Christ and revolution become subt
ly synonymous. Bely’s reaction Is Instructive as well
m curious. It revealg the sweep of the new motif, the
conquest of the old by the new. Even the religious
•re beginning to be converted —while Bely’s Christian
symbolism may be ancient and encumbering, sentimen
’’T md mawkish, the mood awaked in him by the revo
>n is indicative of the penebrativenees and power
. ihe new culture.
In the stories of Pilniak, Ivanov, Setfuliaa, Semenov
and many others the tempo of the revolution has trans
lated Itself into the spirit at fiction. The stories of
these new writers, many of whom are not members of
the Communist Party, are all infused with new resolve,
characterized by new dynamics. The morbkl, mystical
motif of Dostoievsky, so vivid an expression of pre
revolutionary Russia, has been dlsoarded. Literature
has become extrovert. - The introspective is unempha
aied. As in the literature that preceded the Renais
sance, Individual eccentricity is uncultivated. Great
motifs, social motifs, revolutionary motifs have become
the fashion. Mayakovsky does not sing of a lock of
hair but of social revolution. An active era, poet and
novelist write of active things, moving things, chang
ing things, dynanfic things. •
Meanwhile In America, Waldo Frank, with the pan
dorous pomp of a heirophant, prepares ns “to enter
the domain of the noumenal,” to “receive mystery""
which “is tho beginning of participation tn a truth
merely beyond tho scope of our accepted words,’’ and
to perceive In “metaphysics and a true understanding
of the religious experience,’’ the solution of our dilem
ma.
In the antagonisms of the two reactions is reflected
a contrast in cultures. The one exhales the vivd vi
tality of a rising culture, the other the parlhian re
treat of a decadent one.

Listen listen!
I hear something;
Do you heart it?
Something walking;
Do you feel it?
How it vibrates
When its heel and toe
Make contact with the-earth.
It is something, something walking,
And its strides are long and heavy.
I hear something,
Something walking.
Listen!
Listen, Listen!

Do you hear them ?
Voices chanting; '
Do you feel them?
There are husky voices chanting
In a solemn monotonej
And the rumble of their voices
Sounds like distant thunder,
Distant thunder and a storm.
I hear voices,
Voices chanting.
Listen!
lAsten, listen!
It is coming:
Do you heart it?
Coming towards us;
Do you feel it? „
For its heavy boot bites deeper in the earth;
And the thunder of the voices,
Interspersed with bitter laughter,
Knifes the silence -with the lightning
Os impending storm.
It is coming,
Coming towards us.
Listen!
Listen, listen ! *
They are reading; reading;
Do you hear them ?
Proclamations ;
Understand them?
They arc reading proclamations
That banish us from earth.
It’s the revolutionary workers
Seising power of the notion
For their red flags flood the city
In a scarlet flame.
They are reading proclamations
That banish us from earth.

Is no miracle, but a natural phenomenon. The
revolution is the mission of the ""Scythians,” the
Asiatics, who “Have held the armour shield be
tween two hostile races, that of the Mongols and
of Europe."" For generations, these Scythians
have been mocked and oppressed. Then came the
' hour of reckoning and the Russian sphynx look

T)EEPING over the edge of column we see that
Comrade Calverton goes to bat on Russian culture.
That's a good tip. We’ll put one over on Russian physl
culture to keep him company. In R&ssia they believe
these two go together.
Two years ago when the British Trade Union Dele
gation £ave Russia the once over they found 2,400 fac
tory clubs with over a million members promoting
sports. The trade unions backed these clubs. They
have their teams in soccer, wrestling and gym work.
Swedish drill is the big feature. Moscow had 39,000
physical culture circles and It was estimated the Work
ers Clubs had a total of 100,000 circles. They have
grown fast since then.
Sports magazines from Russia come occasionally to
the Bug. (We'll send a copy to any American sports
Bug that’s interested.) Boxing, the noble art of nulli
fying noses, is unknown there. Soccer is the big game.
Russian soccer teams played in Germany last year
and ran some of the best European teams bow-legged.
The other day, a recent visitor to Russia told us that
baseball teams were springing up in many towns.
Here’s hoping they learn the game well enuf to send
over a team with a pitcher good enuf to make Babe
Ruth think he’s got holes in his bat.
In this country the boss backs up sports In the ehop.
In Russia sports are run by workers and organised
Labor tracks them. A little of- that here Will do the
Labor Movement a lot of good.
• • • • •
TTERE’S something the British Trade Union Delega
tion learned that most Sport Bugs don’t know. In
Russia: “A worker who is suffering from fatigue, or Is
run down in general health, by application to his
Trade Union is sent to one of these establishments
(rest homes) free of charge. The rest houses have a
considerable acreage of ground attached to them wheire
games are organized.’’
When you get weak in the knees from turning .oat
■production on your machine for a number of years;
ir when you feel you got lead in your feet at the end
if a hard day’s work—think this over! In Russia the
nen who work—get rest and sports. In this country
:he men who work —get more work. And the more
hey work the more the boss rests . . . and the more
he plays golf.

A COUPLE of weeks ago we spoke of the way Negro
athletes were Jim-Crowed at college. Now Ray
Vaughn of the Colgate team reports he was kept out
of the game against Pittsburgh because of a protest
made by that team against his presence In the game.
He reports also that the manager received a letter from
the Navy officials prohibiting his playing against
them. He had played every game on the Colgate
schedule previous to these games.
Further evidence of race-prejudice in American col
leges bobbed up in the Chieago-Penn game. Coach
Stagg of Chicago sent in Fouehe, a colored line-man.
Here’s the result as a newspaper viciously reports it:
“Few persons in the stands knew that Chicago sent in
a colored substitute lineman near the end of the game.
As it happened, Ed Fonde, of Mobile, was paired against
him. Thayer tried to tell the Southerner his opponent
was a Jap. To prevent trouble the Penn coaches called
n Miller to relieve Fonde.”
The Hogro athlete sur<s gets a dirty deal at college.
These huge “foot-ball stadiums with class rooms around
them"" where is rife, are misleadingly
called “centers of education.”

There are many Workers Sports Clubs thrnout the*
country. We will be glad to give notice of their ac
tivities if you will send the information to the Maga
zine Section for the Sports.
gan, a struggle for life and death, and all nature
echoes with its music, the music of hatred and
love, of destruction and creation.
Many have heard this muwic, but Alexander
Blok was the llrst to introduce it* notes into
l literature, the literature of Russia and of the
world.
“The Twelve"" and ""Scythians"" are not a turn
ing point in Blok's croiftlve activity, but merely
u further phase in his development. They are
the most forceful expression of Blok’s vision of
Russia as the heart of a new world culture, and

Blacklist Is Plan
For Longshoremen
| Government to Register
Dockmen, Outlaw
All Strike*
»> StYMOIH WALD MAN
Daily Worker Washington Bureau)
WASHINGTON, D. C., Jan. 7—A
Plan to Decasualize Longshore
abor ’ is the innocent name of the
report just proposed by the
'labor Department for incorporation
Ito the pending shipping code
J yn up by the American Ship
j era Association.
! his report, written by Boris Stern
,he United States Bureau of La-
Statistics of the Labor Depart
' .he'nt, proposes as one of its fun
damental planks ‘the complete
registration of all longshore labor
available"" in every American ;x>rt.
Blacklist Plank
If adopted, the decesualization
plan will not only increase the
effectiveness of the blacklist against
nilitant labor, especially the mem
bers of the Marine Workers Indus
trial Union, but also will be the
spearhead of the attack against
anti-war activity on the docks.
Decasuaiization is defined in the
•eport as ""primarily a problem in
the technique of employment and i
work distribution, vitally affecting |
the interests of employers and
workers alike,"" and ""an authorita
tive and impartial agency with un
questioned trust and support front
all interests involved,” therefore,
ays the labor department, should
do “the actual work of decasual
:zing the port and of maintaining a
central employment station for
longshore labor.""
Board of “Final Authority""
It is proposed that this “Authorita
tive and Impartial ’ Agency should be
the product of the cooperation of the
strike-breaking national Recovery
Administration and the Department
of Labor. The report says:
“The National Recovery Adminis
tration shall appoint a National De
casuaiization Board, consisting of
the administrator of the shipping
code, the director of the employment
service of the Department of Labor,
and an advisory board of three em
ployers selected by the code authority
and three workers approved by the
president of the International Long
shoremen’s Association (A. F. of L.).
This National Decasuaiization Board
shall be the responsible and final
authority for the decasuaiization work
in all the ports.”
To Register Workers
The expenses of this board are to
be borne by employers and workers
alike, despite the fact that the
hipping companies receive a total of
.28.000.000 a year in gifts (""subsi
vies”) frpm the Federal Government
ost of the longshoremen |
barely subsist.
The lgeneral requirements without
which cfccasualization is either alto
gether impossible or. if attempted, is
doomed fail of its main objec
tives"" are:
“(I) There must be complete regis
tration of all longshore labor avail
able in the port.
“(2) Only those on the register
should be permitted to work on the
waterfront.
“(3) All employers must give up
their right to hire longshore labor
individually at their piers or else
where and must agree to secure their
labor through the decasualizing
agency only.""
The main points of the proposed
coordination of longshoremen follow:
""Immediately upon the approval of
the plan the employment director
shall proceed with the registration
of all the workers in the port. At
he time of registry each longshore
man shall be given a permanent port
work number. This port number
shall be the only work number used
o designate the particular worker
oy all employers of longshore labor
n the port.""

j Will You Take the Initiative?
NEW YORK.—The immediate need for funds to defray the expenses
of the National Convention Against Unemployment, to take place on
Feb. 3,4, and S in Washington, D. C., is emphasized in the following
statement of the National Committee of the Unemployed Council:
“For nearly two weeks we have been appealing for help—with little
result.
“Three thousand dollars is needed In order to carry through the
preparations for the National Convention Against Hunger and Unem
ployment.
“Food and lodgings must be made available to the delegates at the
special rates consistent with their limited means.
“Meeting halls must be secured in Washington.
“Other provisions for a successful convention must be made by
the National Committee.
“The eyes of the entire country will be focused upon this convention.
We must display a capacity for organization which will encourage and
stimulate the organization of the millions of unorganized.
""DON’T WAIT FOR SOMEONE ELSE! Make up a list of people
who may be expected to lend their support.
“Visit them and get each one to make a maximum contribution.
“Immediately send in all money collected to the National Committee

negro longshoremen. Such discrimi

The report admits that even in

DAILY WORKER. NEW YORK, MONDAY', JANUARY 8, 1934
N. Y. Jobless Meet!
Prepares March On
City Hall Feb. 5
Elect 26 Delegates To
Washington; Adopt
Demands
NEW YORK. The New York
County Conference against Unemploy
ment held Jan. 6, in Christ Church,
344 W. 36th St., with 83 organizations
throughout Manhattan and Harlem
represented by 150 delegates, endorsed
and pledged their support of the
Workers Municipal Relief Ordinance
and the Workers Unemployment In
surance Bill.
The delegates came from A. F. of
L. locals. Rank and File groups. In
dependent Unions, shop groups, T.
U. U. L. affiliates, fraternal orders and
neighborhood Cbganlaztlons and clubs.
A permanent New York County Un
employment Counofl of 47 members
was elected. Twenty-six delegate*
were elected to repiesent the county
at the National Convention against
unemployment, Feb. 3, in Washing
ton. A plan of action and organiza
tion was adopted. A committee of
single unemployed and homelss work
ers was formed to protest and fight
discrimination against these workers
and against the transient camps.
The plan of action adopted included
the demands to be made on Mayor
La Guardia at the city-wide dem
onstration on Feb. 5, at the City Hall.
The program of action points out that
the “economy” program of La
Guardia, cuts wages of city employes,
refuses the unemployed adequate cash
relief, and abolishes the hot lunches
for children in schools.
The conference demanded that La
Guardia give an immediate reply to
the delegation which visited him on
Jan. 2, and which he refused to see.
This delegation was demanding the
passage of the Workers Relief Or
dinance and endorsement of the
Workers Unemployment Insurance i
Bill. The conference demanded that i
La Guardia personally receive the del
egation which will visit him Feb. 5,
the day of the demonstration.
I. Amter, national secretary of the
Unemployed Council, reported on the
campaign for the national convention
against unemployment on Feb. 3 in
Washington. Additional delegates will
be sent by the organizations. The
question of raising funds for sending
he delegates to Washington was
strongly emphasized.

short visit to Acting Secretary of
State Phillips.
It is understood that Mrs. Troy

the S. S. Olympic.
William C. Bullitt, the first Amer
ican ambassador to the Soviet Union,
accompanied by his nine-year old
daughter, Anne, returned with Troy
anovsky to spend three weeks here
superintending the organization of his
staff. He appeared very pleased with
his Russian trip. Asked what had
transpired between him and Troyan
ovsky during their long voyage over,
Bullitt replied: “We talked about
everything under the sun.”
An American exceedingly close to
Bullitt predicted that Troyanovsky,
“is a very charming fellow' and will
have great success here.’’
George A. Morelock, secretary to
Bullitt, was in high spirits and eager
to talk about his trip with his chief.
“How do you like Russia?” several
correspondents asked him.
“Fine. When it gets cold there you
get warm right down to your toes.”
“How did Ambassador Bullitt get
along with the Russians?”’
""The Russians are crazy about Mr.
Bullitt. And they did everything they
could to make him and his little
daughter, Anne comfortable. Mr. Bul
litt is very pleased with the Russian
situation.”
“How about little Anne Bullitt?’”

Budget To Protect

lion for “emergency” expenditures. !
and four billion to pay off or meet
bond maturities.
The R.F.C. will require $3,969,000,- j
000 for purposes not made explicitly i
clear by Roosevelt, but which are j
admitted to entail tremendous sub- !
sidles to monopoly industry.
The Civil Works program will re- !
quire $400,000,000, while the mili- j
iarizsd C.C.C. camps will need $342,- j
000.000 according to Roosevelt.
For the carrying through of the
destruction of crops under the A.A.A.
j the government will require $515,-
000,000, Roosevelt said.
The way in which these funds will
be raised has not yet been made
fully clear, but the appropriation of
$3,650,000,000 of gold from the Fed
eral Reserve banks through a close
to 50 per cent devaluation of the
dollar, and the pumping of three
billions worth of bonds into the Fed
eral Reserve banks through the pow
ers granted the Roosevelt government
by the Thomas amendment, are seen
as early possibilities. In addition,!
new heavy taxes are in view, as well
as further reductions in the wages
of Federal employees.
An analysis of the budget reveals
that the huge 7 billion dollar deficit
that Roosevelt predicted for the com
ing year, will be due largely to tre
mendous war preparations, subsidies
to Wall Street monopoly, interest and
loan payments to the monopoly capi
talist bondholders.
The so-called ordinary budget pro
vides for $510,000,000 for the Army
and Navy, while the “extraordinary”
expenditures provide for over one
billion dollars for the so-called ""pub
lic works” which include aeroplane
and battleship building.
The “ordinary” expenditures pro
vide for over $740,000,000 for the
payment of interest to Wall Street
bondholders, while the “extraordinary
expenditures” provide for nearly four
billion more for subsidies to banks
and monopoly industry.
It is becoming more openly ad
mitted that the Roosevelt rate of
proposed expenditure of one billion
dollars a month will require, in lieu
of a real public works program, huge
subsidies to private industry and
banks, and this seems one of the
basic purposes of the proposed bud
get.
Meanwhile, the R.F.C. has an
nounced that it is nrenared to pump
another $500,000,000 into the laps of
the stockholders of bankrupt banks,
in addition to the billion that has
already been pumped there.

lack of material on the person of George Herman Ruth.
Scholars of 2,000 A.D. may have their difficulties in re
creating modes and styles of the nineteen-twenties, but facta
on Babe Ruth’s mid-riff,s
ankles, biceps, and dietary va
garies will be nothing short of
J plethoric. It if won’t be called the
| Era of Ruth, it’ll be no fault of the
sport writers of this epoch. God
knows they tried hard enough.
• * «
IT’S Success Story, that’s what it
is. Rags to Riches and all that.
George Herman, if von follow your
biographies fairly closely, was
something of a Peck’s Bad Boy on
the Baltimore waterfront, an in
veterate hookey player (hookey, not
hockey, please brother linotypcr),
a fruit swiper, a young lout of
parts, in short. Persisting through
the years is the
§ legend of the
youthful
George’s throw
ing arm and
the catastro
phic happen
ings that befell
various truck
drivers who had
j- the temerity to
I object to the
f depredations of
f , George and his
* “ hand. Accord-
Babe Ruth in 7 to the fable,
Ruth’s unerring
accuracy in hurling tomatoes in
various stages of decrepitude was
one of the things that originally at
tracted one of the fathers of St.
Mary’s Industrial School to the
overgrown youngster. Various
1 cynics, however, speaking in a more
modem temper, have suggested
! that it was nothing of the sort and
i that Babe was put away In a re
form school as something ap
| preaching a potential enemy of
society.
Be that as it may, George devel
oped amazing deficiencies in mathe
matics and all the finer elements of
an education, but made it up to his
own and the satisfaction of the gentle
fathers with .an amazing skill at
pitching a baseball. So good was
the Babe at what our contemporaries
insist on saying is flinging the pellet,
that soon the Baltimore Orioles
picked him up for a mere $25 a
week, the aforementioned gentle
fathers of St. Mary's acting as scouts
and the negotiators of the agreement.
1 The rest of the story is by now
■ commonplace. Babe went to the
Boston Red Sox shortly, pitched in
1 the 1915 World Series and was sold
down the river to the Yankees when
i he demanded a salary of $15,000 a
, year. Miller Huggins took the stout
pitcher, transformed him into an
outfielder and the boys in the press
; box did the rest.
* * *
BASEBALL was reeling from the ef
fects of the 1919 World’s Series.
The little boy pleading with Shoeless
Joe Jackson, “Joe, say it ain't so,” be
-1 came a national symbol of a stricken
> populace. The appointment of Kene
saw Mountain Landis as lord high
: commissioner of the pastime wasn't
enough to fire the imagination of I
a 100,000,000. To wipe off the mark |

The halcyon days, 22-28 . . . GiocJ
Herman’s salary rose in direct pro
portion to his home-run figure*.
Jake Ruppert built the new stadium
for the Yanks. The Babe’s gastro
nomic exploits pushed the Ohio gang
off the front pages. Fifty and sixty
thousand dollar salaries for the Bat
tering Bambino, the Gargantuan
George, was the accepted order of
the day.
...
THEN Came the Flood Tide of
Reaction. Even before the stock
market broke, Babe's physique and
bankroll crumpled under the com
bined assault of his uncontrollable
appetite for frankfurters and his
lack of wisdom in placing bets on
the bangtailed Havana ponies. The
Great Collapse was flashed imme
diately from the Carolinas to
Tokyo. Ruth’s case of acute in
digestion was the beginning of his
downward slide on the baseball
toboggan. Rnth Was Going, and
a new furrow was added to the
national brow.
Fate, however, in the person of ths
percentage-taking Christy Walsh,
soon intervened and a good portion
of Ruth’s money was taken away
from him and put in a trust fund. A
Spartan diet and a strict avoidance
of the seductive weiner was pre
scribed. steam baths and regular
gym work to slice off the roll of lard
that appeared in the region of our
hero’s navel was insisted upon. The
anxious public was spared none of
the details, either.
Today Ruth as a national figure
is gone, along with Volstead and
rugged individualism. And who it
there to mourn, so long as we have
Gehrig and Jimmy Foxx?
